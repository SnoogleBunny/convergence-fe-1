# convergence-fe-1
A frontend assignment from Convergence to grab Json images and sort them recursively.

#2: FE (front end) exercise:

Platform: Android or iOS (React Native)

Language/framework: React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

Requirements: Create a simple mobile app which accomplishes the following:

   * When the app starts, fetch /photos JSON data from the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com website

   * Create a horizontally scrollable list of photos that represent the data you fetched. Each photo should have the “title” text written diagonally across the photo, have rounded corners, a border, and should have a drop shadow.  This should scroll smoothly.

   * The photos that are downloaded must be cached so that if the app is terminated, the next session should not have to download previously downloaded images again.

   * Add a button to the screen below the scrollable photo list. Tapping this button will reorder the list in a completely random order. Use a recursive function to reorder the list.

Extra notes:

We may use a simulator or device to play with the app, on any deployment platform of your choosing. If you prefer that we use iOS or Android, we'll use the platform of your choice when launching. If you'd like you can use GitHub and simply share the public repo URL with us (this is preferred). It's not necessary to actually send us an app package/bundle or any binaries etc. It is not necessary to host anything.

Bonus / optional: Use Expo to distribute the build to someone on our team!
